        In this assignment, I explored real-world security vulnerabilities and presented mitigation strategies. 
        My presentation highlighted the importance of staying proactive in the face of potential cyber threats.
        The dynamic nature of cyber threats, which include both insider and outsider threats, was demonstrated in my presentation. 
        I emphasized the significance of vigilance and proactive defense measures in safeguarding 
        sensitive information and crucial systems by delving into various attack vectors and exploitation techniques.

        With a focus on insider threats, I delved into the nuances of unintentional security breaches caused by employees or other individuals with authorized access. 
        By unraveling the psychology behind such threats and presenting real-world case studies, I highlighted the significance of employee training, 
        access controls, and continuous monitoring as essential layers of defense.
        Conversely, the exploration of outsider threats encompassed a diverse array of scenarios, including data breaches, malware infiltration, and social engineering attacks. 
        Through compelling examples and expert insights, I illuminated the ever-evolving landscape of cyberattacks, demonstrating the necessity of staying one step ahead through regular vulnerability assessments and timely updates.
