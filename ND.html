      Hi there! I'm Divaco Colbert, a dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a passion for cybersecurity and network management. 
      Over the course of my academic journey, I've delved into various projects and assignments that have honed my skills and knowledge in the field. 
      Welcome to my web portfolio, where I'll be showcasing my accomplishments and experiences.

    <center><p>
Internet: Represents the external network where data flows in and out.

<center><p>
Firewall: Serves as the first line of defense, filtering and controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.
</p>
<p>
Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple application servers for load distribution and redundancy.
</p>
<p>
Web Server, Application Server, Database Server: These components make up the core infrastructure of an application. The web server handles client requests, the application server processes logic, and the database server stores and retrieves data.
</p>
<p>
Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activities or intrusion attempts. It can detect anomalies and raise alerts.
</p>
<p>
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Collects and correlates security data from various sources, including the IDS, logs, and other security tools. It provides a centralized platform for monitoring and analyzing security events.
</p>
<p>
Analyst Workstation: Represents the workstation used by security analysts to review and respond to alerts generated by the IDS and SIEM. Analysts can investigate incidents and take appropriate actions.
Please keep in mind that this description provides a basic overview of the components in a network security monitoring setup. In an actual diagram, you would use appropriate symbols and lines to visually represent these components and their connections.
